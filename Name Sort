Comment: so total number of letters should be disregarded, 
Comment: it' whether the letter in the array index is greater than the letter in the other indices
Comment: Compare letters (higher number in index is lower on the list (DESCENDING ORDER))

Parameters:
Alphabet = array a through z
X = integer
Name = unsorted list of names
Sorted = blank list 
array = blank array local to functionA

Sorted[1] is populated with the first name on list
for X in Name: // functionA 
  create array 
  array is appended by each letter of a name based on the indexed value in Alphabet   
  for Y in array: //function B
    if array[Y] > Sorted[Y]
      continue until the array index value is higher than ordinal list of names under Sorted
    else if  array index values runs out (then it is placed before)
